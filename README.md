# Portfolio-Website
Hi! You just landed on my first portfolio! ðŸ›¸

            www.dawidgieras.com
            
Above you can find a link to my portfolio. This website is based on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript technology. The amount of fun and joy that the moments gave me while creating this project is enormous. Therefore, I would like you to let me know what you think about my project and what you think could be changed!


PS. In addition to having fun, there were also lessons, the most important of which is "first mock-up, then coding!".
